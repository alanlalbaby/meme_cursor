Project Description
[This Chrome extension replaces your boring old cursor with the glorious heads of legendary Malayalam film actors. Every scroll, click, and hover becomes a cinematic experience worthy of applause.]

The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[People are suffering from a severe lack of superstar energy while browsing the internet. Regular cursors are bland, lifeless, and tragically non-Malayalam.]

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
